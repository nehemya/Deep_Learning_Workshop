# Deep_Learning_Workshop
"Practical Deep Learning Workshop" course in BGU. 

In this course, I gained hands-on skills to build and train deep learning models in various domains.
Each assignment has a relevant notebook with detailed code and work process and a final report of the task at hand.

This repository contain 4 assignments as follows:

-Assignment 1 - EDA, CIFAR-10 CNNs, Transfer learning, Features extraction.

-Assignment 2 - EDA, RNNs, time-sereis valiadtion, Embeddings, kaggle "elo" competition.

-Assignment 3 - Product recommendations, siamese-networks, embedding, Feature extraction.

-Assignment 4 - Super resolutions.

The work was done with Eden Levy.
